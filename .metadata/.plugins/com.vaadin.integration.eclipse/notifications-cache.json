It was first released 2012 and has since gained in popularity. In addition to its free tools, Gatling offers a wide range of (commercial) professional services. Gatling is mainly implemented with the Scala programming language (as opposed to Java). In contrast to JMeter\u2019s XML-based test scripts, Gatling creates scripts in Scala, which makes it more convenient for editing scripts with independent IDEs. Another benefit over JMeter, is that Gatling has better built-in support for WebSocket communication.","title":"Performance testing a Vaadin application: Part 4 Gatling","draft":"false","imageUrl":"https:\/\/website.vaadin.com\/hubfs\/MarCom\/4-gatling.png","linkUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/blog\/performance-testing-a-vaadin-application-part-4-gatling","iconUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/documents\/10187\/10395\/tori-icon-blue-bg-90px\/4597dffb-3868-4711-b422-8fc3e71844e6?t=1394217295000","id":"90026","validTo":"2021-02-11T00:00:00Z"},{"orFilters":"true","read":"false","linkText":"Read more","notificationType":"5","validFrom":"2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","body":"There are a lot of reasons to be excited about the new Vaadin client-side model based on LitElement that was introduced in Vaadin 15 and is now being ported to the newest Vaadin 14 version.
